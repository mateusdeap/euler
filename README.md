# Euler Project (In Rust)

Not much to be said. Just me trying to go through the problems in the Euler project and learn Rust through them.

My only aspiration, application wise, is to make the program interactive. For now I'll only be making it output to the console, in order to learn how to use the io module and how to make a good text based program, I guess.

Naturally, any issues are welcome. I'm not really focusing in input validation right now, but only learning Rust. Maybe later I can even add a GUI to this thing? Who knows. I guess that would be my cherry on top, if can do it.

# How to run it

Just clone this repo and `cargo run`. Naturally, you need to have rust installed.

Alternatively, you can download one of the binaries in the releases and execute it manually.
